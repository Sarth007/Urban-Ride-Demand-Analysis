# Urban Ride Usage & Demand Pattern Analysis 🚕📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing urban ride-sharing data to understand **ride demand patterns, pricing behavior, and user usage trends**.  
Using real-world data from Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, the project applies **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques** to derive meaningful, business-oriented insights.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand how **ride demand varies by time and location**
- To analyze **price variation and surge pricing behavior**
- To compare **peak vs non-peak usage patterns**
- To summarize findings in a **business-friendly manner**

- Demand analysis by time and location
- Price variation and surge pricing analysis
- Peak vs non-peak usage comparison
- Visual storytelling using charts and plots

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Ride demand peaks during **morning and evening commute hours**
- **Peak hours have higher average prices**, indicating surge pricing
- Certain locations consistently act as **demand hotspots**
- Non-peak hours provide **more affordable ride options**
- Ride usage follows **predictable daily and temporal patterns**

---

## 🧠 Business Impact
The insights from this analysis can help ride-sharing platforms:
- Optimize **driver allocation** during high-demand periods
- Improve **pricing strategies**
- Reduce passenger **wait times**
- Increase **operational efficiency and revenue**
